# Casino-Number-Game
Simple Casino Number Game in Java using Packages.
I have used two User-Defined Packages : 
  1) CasinoGame (Main Package that is to be imported.) - Every method is called and executed in this package.
  2) NumGame (Secondary but very Important Package.) - User's data is stored and calcuated in this package.

And then there is a Main.java file that consists of only 7 lines. 
Users can use the Package simply by  importing it into a Java program. 
There is also  a Windows batch file that allows users to execute multiple commands at the command prompt with a single click. 
This is a fun and easy-to-use project that allows users to import packages and start the game.
